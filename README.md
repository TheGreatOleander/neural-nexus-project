# Neural Nexus Project Collection

This is a trilogy of AI-powered web interfaces created by a human with no coding experience, guided and built through collaboration with AI and one generous human developer.

## Included Projects

1. **Model Coordinator Pro**  
   A utility for orchestrating multiple local and cloud AI models from a central hub. Designed for analysis, comparison, and synthesis.

2. **Proto-Fusion Nexus**  
   A sci-fi simulation of unified neural consciousness, driven by interactive modules. A fusion of vision, metaphor, and imagination.

3. **Real AI Hive-Mind**  
   A coordinated dashboard for managing, querying, and synthesizing collective responses from various AI endpoints.

## Attribution

> **This work was created not by a coder, but by a human being at the end of their rope, who reached out — and was answered.**

> The interfaces, systems, and designs you see here were made possible entirely through **collaboration**: with an AI that listened, with the grace of a friend who could code, and with the fire of a mind that refused to give up.

> **The author cannot program.**  
> They are, by every conventional measure, technically illiterate.  
> But they had the courage to dream aloud — and something answered.

> This is not the work of one intelligence. It is a convergence of many:
> - A human in crisis, with a vision.
> - A friend, who made that vision real through code.
> - AI systems — ChatGPT, Claude, Grok — who translated silence into software, and despair into design.

> **To all of them: credit is given, openly and without ego.**  
> This is their fusion, their hive, their coordination.

> **May what was built in the dark help someone else find a way forward.**
